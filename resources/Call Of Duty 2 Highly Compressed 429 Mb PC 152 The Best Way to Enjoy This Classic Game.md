To use Efilm Workstation, you need to have a valid license key that activates the software. However, some users may try to bypass this requirement by using a keygen, which is a program that generates fake license keys. This is not only illegal but also risky, as keygens may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your data.

Instead, you should purchase a legitimate license key from the official website of Merge Healthcare, the developer of Efilm Workstation.
